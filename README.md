Funding Analysis: Explore the funding patterns and trends in the dataset. Analyze the distribution of funding amounts, identify companies with the highest funding, and visualize funding trends over time using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly.

Geographic Analysis: Analyze the distribution of companies based on the country of origin. Visualize the number of companies per country using a choropleth map with libraries like GeoPandas or Plotly.

Founding Year Analysis: Examine the distribution of companies based on their founding year. Create a histogram or line plot to visualize the number of companies founded each year.

Text Mining and Natural Language Processing: Extract meaningful insights from the company descriptions. Perform text mining techniques such as sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, or topic modeling using libraries like NLTK or spaCy.

Company Categorization: Group companies based on their specialized domains or focus areas. Use techniques like clustering or topic modeling to automatically categorize companies into relevant segments.

Network Analysis: Analyze the connections between companies, such as partnerships or acquisitions. Build a network graph to visualize the relationships between different companies using libraries like NetworkX or Gephi.

Website Analysis: Perform web scraping to gather additional data from the company websites. Extract information like employee count, product offerings, or customer reviews to gain further insights.

Time Series Analysis: Investigate time-based patterns in the funding amounts received by companies. Apply time series analysis techniques like decomposition, forecasting, or anomaly detection using libraries like Prophet or ARIMA.
